# Dockerized-Spring-Boot-on-Kubernetes

This is simple Spring Boot Application with Docker and Kubernetes
DockerFile and demo-k8s-yaml file containes the information of docker image and k8s deployments details respectively
There are many ways to run K8s.
If you want to run locally,use minikube as it supports latest version of K8s and if you want to run on cloud,use any of the cloud providers.
I have tested this application using Google K8s Engine
